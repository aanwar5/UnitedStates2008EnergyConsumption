# UnitedStates2008EnergyConsumption
This Repository has been made solely for the purpose of Displaying and portraying the data of the consumption and production of electricity from various sources by using data science techniques; cleaning, wrangling, and visualization by using Python on Jupyter Labs. 
All of the raw data which had been provided was downloaded from the following link : https://openei.org/doe-opendata/dataset/410b0ff8-30fc-4d99-98ba-507a758a80e3/resource/c751e8d4-b0ce-413a-ada7-edb2cb736f30/download/2008state.electricity.generation.v.consumption.xlsx
Please note that this is for my final year project. Will be made public upon graduation.
